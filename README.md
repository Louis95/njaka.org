## Welcome to Njaka.org

Njaka is a volunteer-led movement of free ​computer​ programming/entrepreneurial workshops for young people aged 8-18.

We are a non-profit group of programmers and tech enthusiasts determined to give every Cameroonian child access to the digital skills they need today to build the future they love.  

We encourage inclusive and sustainable learning by teaching kids and educators who play a crucial role in their development. At Njaka, we believe in making sure kids have the confidence and creative tools they need to build a better future through coding.
